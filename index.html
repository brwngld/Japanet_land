    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>Our project was born out of a deep-rooted desire to bridge the gap between Africans living abroad and the rich offerings of our local markets.
      As people who have family members spread around the globe, we frequently learn that they constantly long for the tastes, smells, and memories of home.</p>
    <p>It all began with a sincere chat among friends, during which we expressed our desire for the lively marketplaces and varied merchandise that characterize our cultural history.
      We saw a platform that would make it simple for Africans living abroad to obtain local items, no matter where they were in the world. We realized that this platform had enormous potential to help Africans reconnect with their roots.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to not only make life easier for our fellow Africans living abroad, but also to show the world the beauty and abundance of our regional products.
      Our goal is to support local producers and artisans while celebrating our cultural heritage by introducing our products to international markets.</p>
    <p>Every member of our team contributes to the success and genuineness of our platform with a different set of abilities, experiences, and cultural insights. This project is more than simply a commercial venture;
      it's evidence of our commitment, inventiveness, and steadfast faith in the transformative potential of technology to unite people from different backgrounds.</p>
    <p>In <strong>February, 2024</strong> , we started our trip by coming up with ideas and organizing the project. We've since started a development journey, refining the functionality and design to guarantee a smooth and enjoyable user experience.</p>
    <p>This project is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School. <a href="https://holbertonschool.com" target="_blank">Holberton School</a></p>
